Stairs are a very interesting subject, these contraptions have a very peculiar ability, the power to eleveate and lower an object by simply walking on top of the stairs.
###  Types of Stairs
One of the one things that many interior stairs will have is aesthetics that sacrifice reliability and can actually become dangerous.

### Exhibit A:

While you may think these stairs are cool, they are merely carried by the gimmick of being a chain of DNA, in reality they are actually terribly designed as stairs. For one, they are very steep between each step. Walking up and down stairs is muscle memory to many people so tiny deviations can be deadly to some and could cause injuries. These stairs' own shadows indicate that there is a possiblity they overlap which means you can trip on the underside of the steps and also sacrifice foot space when going down the stairs, yet another hazard.

However when you are able to create something that is aesthetically pleasing and not make it a hazard, the result is quite nice.

Just like the DNA stairs, these Piano stairs are aestheticlaly pleasing to look at. However, unilike those dangerous steep steps, the Piano stairs are a simple straight set of stairs and aren't hazardous aft all making this a very nice set of stairs.
